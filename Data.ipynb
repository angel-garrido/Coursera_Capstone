This dataset has accident traffic records from 2014 to present in Seattle area. \n\nData is available at https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv\n\nThe data consists of 37 independent variables and 194,673 rows. The dependent variable, \u201cSEVERITYCODE\u201d, contains numbers that correspond to different levels of severity caused by an accident from 0 to 4.\n\nSeverity codes are as follows:\n\n0 Little to no Probability (Clear Conditions)\n1: Very Low Probability \u2014 Chance or Property Damage\n2: Low Probability \u2014 Chance of Injury\n3: Mild Probability \u2014 Chance of Serious Injury\n4: High Probability \u2014 Chance of Fatality\n\nThe attributes explored in detail in this project are: \n\n- PERSONCOUNT: The total number of people involved in the collision.\n- PEDCOUNT: The number of pedestrians involved in the collision. This is entered by the state.\n- PEDCYLCOUNT: The number of bicycles involved in the collision. This is entered by the state. \n- VEHCOUNT: The number of vehicles involved in the collision. This is entered by the state. \n- INCDATE: The date of the incident. \n- JUNCTIONTYPE: Category of junction at which collision took place \n- SDOT_COLDESC: A description of the collision corresponding to the collision code. \n- WEATHER: A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision. \n- ROADCOND: The condition of the road during the collision. \n- LIGHTCOND: The light conditions during the collision. \n- SPEEDING: Whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision.
